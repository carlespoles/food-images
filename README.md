# Food Images
Food images that can be used to train a convolutional neural network. 20,000 in total, 10,000 of each class.

I used them in [this deep learning project](https://github.com/carlespoles/DSCI6051-student) where all details can be found.

The good quality images are labeled as "tasty" and were downloaded from `epicurious.com`. Each folder has 1,000 images.

The bad quality images are labeled as "not-tasty" and were downloaded from `food.com`. Each folder has 1,000 images.

Here are the [details on using the imagenet files](https://github.com/carlespoles/DSCI6051-student/blob/master/17-transfer-learning-InceptionV3-data-prep-1.ipynb).
